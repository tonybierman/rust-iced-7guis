## Requirements

Build a frame containing:
- A label or read-only textfield (T) displaying a numeric value
- A button (B) for incrementing the counter

### Behavior
- Initial value in T is "0"
- Each click of B increases the value in T by one

### Goals
- Demonstrate basic Iced scaffolding
- Demonstrate simple state management
- Show how fundamental Iced features work together
- Minimal complexity and scaffolding

## About 7GUIs: A GUI Programming Benchmark

There are countless GUI toolkits in different languages and with diverse approaches to GUI development. Yet, diligent comparisons between them are rare. Whereas in a traditional benchmark competing implementations are compared in terms of their resource consumption, here implementations are compared in terms of their notation. To that end, [7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) defines seven tasks that represent typical challenges in GUI programming. In addition, 7GUIs provides a recommended set of evaluation dimensions.
